# Flower Simulation Step-by-Step

This directory contains the code developed in the `Flower Simulation 2025` tutorial series on Youtube. You can find all the videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNG4feLHqCWkdlSrEL2xbCtGa6QBxlUZb) or clicking on the video preview below.

## Complementary Resources

In this tutorial series, we make reference to several pages in the [Flower Documentation](https://flower.ai/docs/). In particular, this videos highlight pages for:

- [Visualizing Dataset Distributions using `flwr-datasets`](https://flower.ai/docs/datasets/tutorial-visualize-label-distribution.html)
- [List of all Partitioners available in `flwr-datasets`](https://flower.ai/docs/datasets/ref-api/flwr_datasets.partitioner.html)
- [How-to Run Simulations page](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/how-to-run-simulations.html)
- [How-to Design Stateful ClientApps](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/how-to-design-stateful-clients.html)
- [Advanced PyTorch Example](https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/examples/advanced-pytorch)

## Getting Started

> \[!TIP\]
> If you are developing on Windows, it is recommended to make use of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Check the guide on [how to setup WSL for development on Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl).

> \[!NOTE\]
> These steps represent the very first commands show on the first video. They `flwr new` command will create a Flower App you can run directly. In videos 2-7 you'll learn how to modify the App and add, step by step, the functionality already present in the `my-awesome-app` diredtory in this directory. You can use it as reference.

As presented in the video, we start from a new Python 3.11 environment. You only need to activate it and install `flwr`.

```bash
# Install Flower
pip install -U flwr
```

Then, use the `flwr new` command to construct a new Flower App using the PyTorch template:

```shell
flwr new my-awesome-app # then follow the prompt
```

## Running the Example

Just like all other Flower Apps, you can run the one in this directory by means of `flwr run`. More info about this command in the videos!

```shell
flwr run my-awesome-app
```

The output you should expect without making changes to the code is as follows:

```shell
